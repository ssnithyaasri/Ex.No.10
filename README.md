# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:
## Reg. No:212222230100

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Instructions:
1.	Select a Topic: Choose a topic (e.g., market trends, climate change, sci-fi story) that interests you.
2.	Use Basic Prompts: Start by crafting simple, general prompts to generate initial content.
3.	Refine Your Prompts: Gradually introduce more complexity by adding details, refining the structure, and using different prompt techniques like decision making or semantic filtering.
4.	Evaluate the Output: Review the generated content for clarity, creativity, and accuracy.
5.	Iterate for Improvement: Based on the feedback, refine the prompts and regenerate the content as needed.

## Deliverables:
1.	First Draft: A basic draft of the report, case study, article, or story generated using simple prompts.
2.	Refined Content: A more detailed and structured output, achieved by applying more advanced prompt techniques.
3.	Multiple Versions: Different versions of the content, showing the effect of prompt changes on the output.
4.	Final Version: The polished version of the content after incorporating feedback and refining the prompts.

## Objective

This experiment explores how different prompting techniques influence the quality, coherence, and structure of AI-generated content. By using ChatGPT to generate a creative story—specifically, a comic book titled "TimeBot in the Land of Pharaohs"—we demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced prompting strategies like query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, and role-based prompting.

## Case Study Focus: Comic Book Script

Story Concept: A futuristic robot accidentally travels back to Ancient Egypt, interacts with locals, and faces a decision to either influence history or return to its time.
 
## Prompting Techniques Explored

We selected five prompting techniques and used each to generate a version of the comic script. Below is a breakdown of each technique, its prompt style, and a brief analysis.

### 1.Basic Prompting

Prompt:“Write a short comic book script about a robot who time-travels to ancient Egypt.”

Pros:

Quick and easy

Generates general content

Cons:

Lacks detail and structure

May result in generic or shallow narrative

Output Summary:A simple 4–5 panel story with limited character development and minimal plot depth.

###  2.Query Decomposition

Method: Break the request into multiple specific questions.

Decomposed Prompts:

Describe the robot’s appearance and abilities.

What triggers the time travel?

How do Egyptians react?

What moral dilemma does the robot face?

Compiled Prompt:“Using the above responses, write a detailed comic book script involving a time-traveling robot in ancient Egypt.”

Pros:

Improved depth and plot consistency

Each story element is more grounded and logical

Cons:

Time-consuming setup

Requires combining sub-responses into a final output

Output Summary:Well-structured story with coherent character arcs and emotional engagement.

### 3. Decision-Making Prompting

Prompt:“Write a comic book script where a robot lands in ancient Egypt and must choose between helping build a city or returning to its own time. Show both choices and the outcome.”

Pros:

Introduces interactivity and complexity

Highlights character motivation and consequences

Cons:

May require additional clarification to avoid narrative confusion

Output Summary:Dynamic story with a clear dilemma and branching narrative; encourages critical thinking.

### 4. Semantic Filtering

Prompt:“Write a comic book script for 10-year-old readers. The story should feature a time-traveling robot in ancient Egypt, written in an adventurous, humorous tone with age-appropriate dialogue.”

Pros:

Audience-focused tone and content

Improves readability and engagement for target groups

Cons:

Limits vocabulary and themes

Risk of oversimplifying complex plot points

Output Summary:Engaging, age-appropriate script with educational elements about ancient Egypt.

### 5. Role-Based Prompting

Prompt:“You are a professional comic book writer creating a 6-panel script titled ‘TimeBot in the Land of Pharaohs.’ Make it visually descriptive and suitable for middle school readers.”

Pros:

Provides role-based context and expectations

Enhances realism and stylistic alignment

Cons:

Heavily relies on role assumption

May not always be intuitive for beginners

Output Summary:Professionally structured panels, complete with visual guidance, dialogue, and narrative pacing.

## Key Insights

Prompt Structure Matters: The more detailed and structured the prompt, the more refined the output.

Combining Techniques (e.g., semantic filtering + decision-making) produces the best results.

Creative Control Increases as prompt specificity increases.

Educational Potential can be maximized by filtering tone and complexity through semantic guidance.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is not just a technical skill—it’s a creative design process that can radically change the nature and quality of AI-generated content. By using varied prompting strategies, creators can fine-tune AI outputs for different formats, purposes, and audiences—whether crafting an analytical report or building a vivid comic world.
